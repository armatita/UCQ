# UCQ
UCQ (upscale by convolution quality) is a simple alternative algorithm to upscale well data considering how well it will relate with the seismic data behind it. User needs to input well data (original, not upscaled), seismic data (numpy binary), and wavelet (2 columns text file) and the algorithm will return the upscale.
